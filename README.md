# Real-or-Rendered-AI-Generated-vs.-Real-Image
This project uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images as AI-generated or real. Trained on a diverse dataset, it employs data augmentation and transfer learning to improve accuracy. Preliminary results show effective classification, with applications in media authenticity, security, and digital forensics.
